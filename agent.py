AIOOS agent loop, stitched end to end:
  situation -> encode -> retrieve relevant memories -> decide (LLM via OpenRouter) -> respond
The 'test' compares the SAME situation WITH vs WITHOUT memory, to prove the memory layer actually
changes what the NPC does (if it doesn't, the whole memory stack is decorative).
